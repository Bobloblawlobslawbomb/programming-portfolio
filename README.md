_{Leave nothing to chance. It should be easy for anyone to run your app. All the things necessary to make it happen, including otherr software or hardware setups needed. A good idea may be to delete the folder from your local machine and re-clone the project from Github and writting down all the necessary steps to get the application working again}_
